# Numerical Integration Microservice

## Description

- This project involves the creation of a microservice for numerical integration using the Flask framework in Python. The numerical integration is performed for the function abs(sin(x)) within a specified interval, and the program is designed to break the interval into N subintervals, compute the area of the rectangle at each subinterval, and add them all up. The ultimate goal is to observe the convergence of the result to 2 as N increases.

## Numerical Integration Program

- The numerical integration program is implemented in Python and can be found in the file `integration.py`. The program iteratively computes the numerical integral for various values of N (1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000) and prints the results.
